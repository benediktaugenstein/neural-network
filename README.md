# neural-network
A simple neural network from scratch, built in Python.

# Usage
This neural network analyzes an initial input with 4 values per row in the input dataset.
Each row is matched with a result (this is what we want to predict in the end).

# Layers
This neural network includes 3 layers:
- Input layer
- Hidden layer
- Output layer

The input layer consists of 4 neurons, the hidden layer of 5.
In the output layer there is only going to be one neuron which gives us our final output.

# Weights and biases
Each layer is connected via weights which are going to be changed automatically during the backpropagation which resembles the learning process of our neural network.
The same applies for biases which are added to the neural network in the input and hidden layer.
