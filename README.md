# neural-network
A simple neural network from scratch, built in Python.

# Layers
This neural network includes 3 layers:
- Input layer
- Hidden layer
- Output layer

# Weights and biases
Each layer is connected via weights which are going to be changed automatically during the backpropagation which resembles the learning process of our neural network.
The same applies for biases which are added to the neural network in the input and hidden layer.
